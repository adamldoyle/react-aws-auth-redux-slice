# react-aws-auth-redux-slice

Extension of [@adamldoyle/react-aws-auth-context-core](https://github.com/adamldoyle/react-aws-auth-context-core) that listens to Auth context changes and adds the session and profile to an authentication Redux slice.

## Features

1. Automatically detects profile/session changes and keeps them up-to-date in Redux
2. Provides several selectors to extract information

## Installation

1. `yarn add @adamldoyle/react-aws-auth-redux-slice`
2. Build auth slice using `buildAuthSlice` which returns `authSlice`, `authSelectors`, `AuthInjector`
3. Nest `AuthInjector` within `AuthContextProvider` (from [@adamldoyle/react-aws-auth-context-core](https://github.com/adamldoyle/react-aws-auth-context-core) or a related component library) and containing the rest of your application component heirarchy
4. Use selectors provided by `authSelectors` to select session/profile information as necessary
